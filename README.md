## Intermediate Machine Learning

1. [Introduction](intermediate_machine_learning/01-introduction.ipynb)   
Review what you need for this Micro-Course.

2. [Missing Values](intermediate_machine_learning/02-missing-values.ipynb)  
Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

3. [Categorical Variables](intermediate_machine_learning/03-categorical-variables.ipynb)   
There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning.

4. [Pipelines](intermediate_machine_learning/04-pipelines.ipynb)  
A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.

5. [Cross-Validation](intermediate_machine_learning/05-cross-validation.ipynb)  
A better way to test your models.

6. [XGBoost](intermediate_machine_learning/06-xgboost.ipynb)  
The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.

7. [Data Leakage](intermediate_machine_learning/07-data-leakage.ipynb)  
Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.
