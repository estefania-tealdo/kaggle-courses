## Intro to SQL

1. [Getting Started With SQL and BigQuery](intro_to_sql/01-getting-started-with-sql-and-bigquery.ipynb)   
Learn the workflow for handling big datasets with BigQuery and SQL.

2. [Select, From & Where](intro_to_sql/02-select-from-where.ipynb)  
The foundational compontents for all SQL queries.

3. [Group By, Having & Count](intro_to_sql/03-group-by-having-count.ipynb)   
Get more interesting insights directly from your SQL queries.

4. [Order By](intro_to_sql/04-order-by.ipynb)  
Order your results to focus on the most important data for your use case.

5. [As & With](intro_to_sql/05-as-with.ipynb)  
Organize your query for better readability. This becomes especially important for complex queries.

6. [Joining Data](intro_to_sql/06-joining-data.ipynb)  
Combine data sources. Critical for almost all real-world data problems.


## Advanced SQL

1. [JOINs and UNIONs](advanced_sql/01-joins-and-unions.ipynb)   
Combine information from multiple tables.

2. [Analytic Functions](advanced_sql/02-analytic-functions.ipynb)  
Perform complex calculations on groups of rows.

3. [Nested and Repeated Data](advanced_sql/03-nested-and-repeated-data.ipynb)   
Learn to query complex datatypes in BigQuery.

4. [Writing Efficient Queries](advanced_sql/04-writing-efficient-queries.ipynb)  
Write queries to run faster and use less data.




## Feature Engineering

1. [Baseline Model](feature_engineering/01-baseline-model.ipynb)   
Building a baseline model as a starting point for feature engineering.

2. [Categorical Encodings](feature_engineering/02-categorical-encodings.ipynb)  
There are many ways to encode categorical data for modeling. Some are pretty clever.

3. [Feature Generation](feature_engineering/03-feature-generation.ipynb)    
The frequently useful case where you can combine data from multiple rows into useful features.

4. [Feature Selection](feature_engineering/04-feature-selection.ipynb)  
You can make a lot of features. Here's how to get the best set of features for your model.


## Intermediate Machine Learning

1. [Introduction](intermediate_machine_learning/01-introduction.ipynb)   
Review what you need for this Micro-Course.

2. [Missing Values](intermediate_machine_learning/02-missing-values.ipynb)  
Missing values happen. Be prepared for this common challenge in real datasets.

3. [Categorical Variables](intermediate_machine_learning/03-categorical-variables.ipynb)   
There's a lot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for machine learning.

4. [Pipelines](intermediate_machine_learning/04-pipelines.ipynb)  
A critical skill for deploying (and even testing) complex models with pre-processing.

5. [Cross-Validation](intermediate_machine_learning/05-cross-validation.ipynb)  
A better way to test your models.

6. [XGBoost](intermediate_machine_learning/06-xgboost.ipynb)  
The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.

7. [Data Leakage](intermediate_machine_learning/07-data-leakage.ipynb)  
Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle ways.
